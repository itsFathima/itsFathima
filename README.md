- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @itsFathima
- ðŸ‘€ I believe Software development is more about communication and knowledge exchange than producing actual code, which creates liabilities and thus should be well founded.
Or as Martin Fowler puts it:


    `Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.`
